## Passmenu Script

The current `passmenu` is now part of `pass` itself! The script is available bundled at
[`contrib/dmenu/passmenu`][upstream]. Please go there for future updates.

This is my fork to use it in ubuntu, the pass version into ubuntu is 1.7.4 at this moment. I use dmenu, but I prefer to use the script by itself.

**This script**

- Add a password if that password doesn't exist
  - Ask for how many characters
  - Ask if we want spacial characters
    - That means if use the -n flag or not
